Lets the admin add "featured" or "buried" css class to selected comments. Handy to highlight comments that add value to your post.

This plugin makes use of the meta_query option added in WordPress 3.5 to the WP_Comment_Query class, so it is no longer compatible with earlier versions of WordPress.

Please report bugs and suggestions on [Github](https://github.com/pippinsplugins/Featured-Comments).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload 'feature-comments' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

All the options will be automatically added to the edit comments table, and single comment edit screen
